# Bene — Decentralized Fundraising Platform (Ergo)

![Bene Logo](static/favicon.png)

## Overview

**Bene** is a fully decentralized, client-side fundraising platform built on the **Ergo blockchain**, implementing a **Proof-of-Funding** model.  
It removes the need for trust in centralized intermediaries by enforcing fundraising logic entirely through immutable smart contracts.

Projects can access funds **only if predefined success conditions are met**, while contributors are guaranteed refunds in case of failure.

---

## Key Properties

- **Trustless Fundraising:** Funds are governed exclusively by smart contracts.
- **Client-Side Only:** No backend servers, databases, or custodial services.
- **Censorship Resistant:** Users connect directly to Ergo nodes and explorers.
- **Deterministic Rules:** Contract logic defines all outcomes — no discretion.

## Architecture Overview

### Serverless & Sovereign by Design

Bene follows a **100% client-side architecture**:

- No centralized backend or API servers
- No proprietary databases
- Direct blockchain interaction from the browser
- User-controlled choice of Ergo nodes and explorers

All business logic, custody, and validation are handled on-chain.

## User Guide (Contributors)

### Token Model

Bene uses a dual-token mechanism to ensure transparent accounting.

#### 1. Auxiliary Project Token (APT)

- Acts as a **temporary receipt** for user contributions
- Represents the contributor’s claim within a campaign
- Used to either:
  - Redeem **PFTs** on success
  - Claim a **full refund** on failure

#### 2. Proof-Funding Token (PFT)

- The **actual project token**
- Released only if the campaign succeeds
- Distributed proportionally to contributors who exchange APTs

---

### Contribution Lifecycle

#### 1. Contribution Phase
- Users contribute ERG or a specified base token
- Funds are locked in the contract
- APTs are minted and issued to contributors
- PFTs remain locked until campaign resolution

#### 2. Resolution Phase

| Outcome | Condition | User Action |
|------|---------|------------|
| Success | Tokens Sold ≥ Minimum Goal (R5) | Exchange APT → PFT |
| Failure | Deadline passed (R4) and goal unmet | Return APT → Full Refund |

### On-Chain Discussions

- Campaigns include a **fully on-chain comment system**
- Discussions are immutable and censorship-resistant
- Based on the Reputation Systems Forum Protocol

## Technical Architecture

### Security Invariant

The contract enforces the following invariant at all times:
